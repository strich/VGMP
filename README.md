# The Video Game Metadata Project
The intention of this project is to provide an extremely easy to view and maintain bridging set of connected metadata for video games. 

## Database Scraper & Parser
The C# project `SoftwareDbParser` is a collection of classes that automate parsing and fuzzy matching databases like Redump.com with available MobyGames.com entries.
